## üìÅ Projects

### 1. Diwali Sales Analysis

This project analyzes sales data from a Diwali festival sale. The aim is to identify key patterns in customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and popular product categories.

#### Key Insights:
- **Gender**: Majority of the buyers are females with higher purchasing power.
- **Age**: Most buyers are aged between 26-35 years.
- **Location**: The highest sales and orders come from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.
- **Marital Status**: Married women dominate the buyer segment.
- **Occupation**: Buyers are mostly from the IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors.
- **Product Preferences**: Food, Clothing, and Electronics are the most sold product categories.

#### Conclusion:
Businesses targeting married women aged 26-35 from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, particularly those working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation, can maximize their sales by focusing on Food, Clothing, and Electronics.

### 2. Optimized Customer Grouping and Their Analysis  
  
This project focuses on optimizing customer segmentation by analyzing purchasing behavior, demographics, and engagement metrics. By identifying distinct customer groups, businesses can enhance marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and drive growth. The project leverages data-driven methods to uncover actionable insights for effective decision-making.  

### Steps  

### **Data Collection**  
The foundation of the project was built by collecting a comprehensive dataset containing customer information. This dataset included:  
- **Demographics** (e.g., income, family composition).  
- **Purchasing Behavior** (spending on categories like wine, meat, and fish).  
- **Engagement Metrics** (responses to marketing campaigns).  

### **Data Exploration and Cleaning**  
Ensuring data quality was critical for accurate analysis. Key actions included:  
- **Understanding Data Structure:** Inspected column types, missing values, and unique entries.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new metrics like `TotalSpending` to summarize customer expenditures across all categories.  
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values and outliers, ensuring the dataset was consistent and reliable.  

### **Descriptive Analysis**  
To identify patterns and trends, statistical analysis was performed:  
- **Income Trends:** Evaluated income distribution and its relationship to spending habits.  
- **Spending Behavior:** Assessed how much customers spent on key categories like wine and fish.  
- **Engagement Levels:** Examined how customers responded to marketing campaigns, identifying active and dormant groups.  

### **Customer Segmentation**  
The core of the project involved clustering customers into meaningful groups:  
- **Feature Selection:** Used relevant attributes such as `Income`, `TotalSpending`, and `NumStorePurchases` for clustering.  
- **Finding Optimal Clusters:** Applied the **Elbow Method** to determine the most suitable number of clusters for grouping customers.  
- **Clustering Process:** Used K-means clustering to group customers based on similarities in behavior, preferences, and demographics.  

### **Visualization of Insights**  
Data visualizations played a crucial role in interpreting and communicating findings:  
- **Spending Patterns:** Histogram of total spend for all customer clusters.  
- **Demographics:** Boxplots for income and family size within each cluster.  
- **Cluster Behavior:** Scatterplots showing the relationship between recency and spending per cluster.  
- **Engagement Trends:** Bar charts depicting campaign responsiveness across clusters.  

### **Key Insights and Recommendations**  
Post-segmentation, actionable insights were derived to guide business decisions:  
- Identified high-spending customer segments for targeted marketing campaigns.  
- Highlighted dormant customers requiring re-engagement strategies.  
- Recommended region-specific inventory adjustments based on state-level sales patterns.
